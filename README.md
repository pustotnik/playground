Some experiments, tests, benchmarks, etc.

- **cpucache**   - just repeated experiments from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIkqP4JbkE
- **microbench** - very small benchmarks to check something
- **fwcmatch**   - own experiment with benchmarking of how the task of reading big
                   log files and filtering them with a wildcard pattern can be
                   solved in a single thread and in multi threads (producer-cunsumer).
